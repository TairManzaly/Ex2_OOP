# Ex2_OOP

in this assignment we were given interfaces to exercise. 
The interfaces included nodes, edges, directed weighted graph and algorithms.
We had to adjust an efficient data structure, and to present the graph and algorithms with GUI backpage.
We implemented classes in order to achieve good results. After we finished implementing the classes we built a GUI class where we presented their graphs and algorithms. 
In the Directed_Weighted_Graph class we have defined a Node_Data hasmap and an edgedata hashmap hasmap.
In the external hasmap the key that defines will be the src and in each of the hasmaps within it the key will be the dest of the edge and thus we will place the ribs according to these keys.
And in the Directed_Weighted_Graph_AlgorithmsI class we implemented different algorithms on a Directed_Weighted_Graph type graph.
For example: isConected algorithm that checks whether the graph is connected or not, save and load algorithms that load and save a graph to a json file and more.
Next, we tested all the functions we performed using tests. 

When you run the jar file with json file, ×© screen size window appears. 
In the menu bar you get 3 objects: file,graph and algorithms.
In the file object you got load function to load node file, save function to save your graph into another file, and exit function to finish the program.
In the graph function you got option to add a new node, connect between nodes with a new edge, and remove edge or node.
In the third object, algorithms, you got a few function on the graph, like function to check if the graph is connected, or what is the shortest path between tow nodes, or a function that return the center of the graph.
